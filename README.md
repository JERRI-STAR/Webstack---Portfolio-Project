Running the Project:

Open the index.html file in a web browser of your choice to view the homepage and navigate through the site.
You can also open any of the other HTML files to view their respective pages.

Usage Guidelines
Navigation:

The website is built with a fixed navigation bar at the top. Use the navigation links to move between different pages such as About, Blog, Products, and Contact.
The buttons on the homepage (like "Explore" and "Contact us") can be clicked to trigger further actions or lead users to other parts of the site.
Responsive Design:

The website is responsive, meaning it adjusts its layout based on the device being used (desktop, tablet, or mobile).
Test the site on various screen sizes to ensure the layout adapts accordingly.
Content Updates:

The content in the HTML files (such as text and links) can be easily updated by editing the corresponding file. For example:
To change the text on the homepage, modify the content inside the <div class="content"> section in index.html.
To update the About section, make changes in the about.html file.
Custom Styling:

Modify the styles.css file to change the design or layout. Any visual changes such as font style, button color, or layout adjustments can be done by editing the CSS selectors in this file.
Use CSS classes like .logo, .content, .btn, etc., to target different elements across pages.
JavaScript Customization:

The script.js file is used for adding interactivity. For example, you can implement functions for dynamic buttons or form validations. Modify this file as needed for any custom features.
Adding New Pages or Features:

To add a new page, simply create a new .html file and link it in the navigation bar (by adding a new <li><a href="newpage.html">New Page</a></li> in the index.html).
Add any new images or assets inside the /assets directory.

Conclusion
Craftify is a simple yet effective web application that provides an intuitive user experience. The structure is easy to extend and customize, making it a great foundation for showcasing products, providing content, and interacting with customers.
